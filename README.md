# Getting Started with Angular: Your First App

This is a deployment for the application created from the [Getting Started with Angular: Your First App](https://angular.io/start) tutorial as a GitHub page.

From the tutorial, this was initially created as a [forked project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-7seatt) on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), then downloaded, tweaked for Angular version differences, and the `built for production`, output imported into this repository.  The running result can be seen at the [angular start](https://mmerlin.github.io/angular-start/) page.

The source code used to generate the application can be found in [it's own GitHub repository](https://github.com/mMerlin/angular-stackBlitz-start).  A `docs` folder in that repository could have been used to host the GitHub page for the application, but a conscious decision was made to emulate a more production type environment, where the generated output is not stored in the source code repository.
